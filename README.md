Hello, this is Voxify, a blogging application. This has two special features apart from just saving viewer and author data and adding,saving and editing posts, that it can fetch posts from different blogging sites and also summarise the posts using LLAMA model. There was a time constraint during making of this project,in spite of this time constraint the dev has given his fullest to remove bugs and error, despite this since it is v1.0.0 of this application there may some bugs here and there. I have deployed the backend on Render, frontend on Vercel and Database on MongoDB atlas.
